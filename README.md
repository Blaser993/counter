# Welcome to PokÃ¨mon counter ðŸ‘¾

This project is a simple counter that adds and substracts numbers.

## How It Works

When you open the app, the counter is at zero. By increasing or decreasing the counter
value with the corresponding PokÃ¨mons ( Plusle and Minum ). You can reset the counter 
by clicking on the Pokeball. 
   
You can also increase the value (1 or 10 or 100 or 1000) of your "click" by clicking 
on the red button below, changing the tier of Pokeball also.

The value of the counter cannot be below 0 or above 999999999.
